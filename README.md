Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hi,

I work at MyCaption.com so I have created a website related to my business. I do not want google to index it so I have added the <META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW"> tag.

Files:
index.html is the homepage. It has 3 images each one with hyperlinks to another page and back to homepage. It also has 3 tabs - Providers, Contact Us and About (with hyperlinks). use of class property of css.

providers.html - table to list the info of Providers and @media feature for smaller screens.

contact.html - uses a grid model with two rows and two columns.

api.html uses nestingApi.css (nestingApi.scss) SCSS nesting.

premiumDictation.html uses premiumDictationStyle.css - SCSS inheritance,

styles.css - uses several css selectors including class, id, etc.

nestingApi.css SCSS nesting for api.html
